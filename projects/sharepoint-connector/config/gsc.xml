Node <gsa> describes a signle Google Search Appliance. 
Node <server> describes a SPS server, or a single Windows Sharepoint Services "Virtual Server". It's equivelent 
to "web site" in IIS. They are presumably extended by Sharepoint.
Multiple GSA can be listed here with <gsa> node. Different Sharepoint servers' content can be fed into
different GSA. The node <gsa> inside <server> node defines the reference.

<gsa>:
The "name" is a descriptive title, usually the host name. The <url> is the actual address.
GSA can be put behind a proxy server.

<servers> node describes attibutes that are common to the Sharepoint servers, or behavior of this connector.
"single_thread" is useful when trying to analyze the feeding results for debugging purpose. Default value
is "false". "save-feed" will tell connector to save the xml content fed to the GSA in the logs directory.
<security> node under "servers" contains the username and password shared by multiple Sharepoint servers. The account information
can be overriden by putting the <security> node under <server>. If it's a domain account (using NTLM, 
for example), use the format domain\username. If a local account is to be used for NTLM authentication,
the "domain" should be the host name.

Sharepoint keeps track of last modified time for the content. The connector
uses that information and only retrieve the changes since last crawl. To make sure
that we don't miss any content, the access time is tracked for each list in this file's
<lists> node. That's why you will see the list group as more lists are created by Sharepoint
users and discovered by the connector. To force a feed of all content, all you have to do
is to remove the content from <lists> section.
